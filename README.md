# Random Number Facts
A Svelte App that uses the [numbers api](http://numbersapi.com) to generate facts from user entered queries.

```
Note:
The deployed site on Netlify may cause issues with Fetch due to Chrome's Mixed Content block. 
Since it's hosted on an https connection while the request is sent on an http connection. 
It can be bypassed by clicking on shield icon on the extreme right in the address bar which says 'load unsafe scripts'.

Currently, this issue is only seen in Chrome. I'll update the code when a permanent fix is found.
